target area: x=20..30, y=-10..-5
7,2; 6,3; 9,0; *6,9* -> 45 is highest y reached on the way
The probe's x,y position starts at 0,0. Then, it will follow some trajectory by moving in steps. On each step, these changes occur in the following order:

    The probe's x position increases by its x velocity.
    The probe's y position increases by its y velocity.
    Due to drag, the probe's x velocity changes by 1 toward the value 0; that is, it decreases by 1 if it is greater than 0, increases by 1 if it is less than 0, or does not change if it is already 0.
    Due to gravity, the probe's y velocity decreases by 1.
